<h2>about</h2>

<p>A probably prime number is a number that passes any of a number of primality heuristics. Proving the primality of a large number is computationally infeasible, but large primes are very useful for cryptography. A relatively small percentage of probably prime numbers end up being pseudoprimes, which are composite numbers that pass the primality heuristics.</p>
